	  that can recover this keys once enough encrypted packets have 
	  been captured. It implements the standard FMS attack along with 
	  some optimizations like KoreK attacks, thus making the attack 
	  much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools. In fact 
	  aircrack is a set of tools for auditing wireless networks.
