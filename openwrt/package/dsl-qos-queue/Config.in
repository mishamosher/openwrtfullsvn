	  This program implements a user space QUEUE processor which controls outbound traffic
	  over a DSL modem using a pseudo- token-bucket-filter style queue with starvation protection.

	  Main feature of this outbound rate limiter is it's ability to rate limit based on the calculated
	  raw bandwidth used rather than just the IP bandwidth used. This provides a MUCH more accurate way
	  to prevent packet queueing in the network device (in this case, ADSL modem).
